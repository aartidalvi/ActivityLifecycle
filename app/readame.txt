When the device is rotated, following counts are incremented on sharedPreferences:
onCreate , onStart, onPause, onSaveInstanceState, onRestoreInstanceState, onStop and onResume.

There is a difference of 1 between count in Bundle(less by 1 than sharedPreference value) and in sharedPreference for following counters:
OnCreateCount, OnStartCount , OnStopCount , OnDestroyCount 
The reason of why these values are different is, we update the bundle in onSaveInstanceState
and then as we rotate the device, these methods are called as per activity lifecycle and count is incremented for them.
